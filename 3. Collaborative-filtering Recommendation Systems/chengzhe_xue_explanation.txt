Comparing with case 3, after applying LSH, the runtime of case 4 reduced by around 100 second, but the accuracy,
i.e. RMSE increased from around 0.9 to around 1.5. The main reason behind this is that, by applying LSH, we can
get the similar business pairs in shorter time, hence reducing the time of finding similar business pairs. However,
the LSH used Jaccard similarity, actually Pearson Correlation is preferred for accuracy, so the accuracy of case 4
was affected and not as good as case 3.
